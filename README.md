Project Pygame: 1st Year University Game Project
================================================

**Pygame:** A 2D platformer game submitted as a 1st year project. The main protagonist is a human that navigates levels with a bow (grappling hook). 

**Pygame Reborn:** Remake of Pygame as a personal side-project. This approach and hence the work in this directory has been abandoned in favour for using Gamemaker.
